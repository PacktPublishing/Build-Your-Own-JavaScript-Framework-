* Runtime: Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version 20+ installed. Using the [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) can help with the Node.js version management on your machine.
* Web Browsers: To explore the front-end applications, please use a modern browser like Chrome or a Chrome-like browser.

## Hardware Requirements

* Processor: Any modern multi-core processor (1 GHz or faster).
* RAM: Minimum 512 MB of memory.
* Storage: The Node.js runtime itself takes less than 100 MB space. However, depending upon the size of your project and the number of dependencies, you might need more. It is recommended to allocate about 10 GBs to accommodate for dependencies in the chapters.
